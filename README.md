　　千年祝福，我诵经佛前，你是我深更木鱼敲响苏醒于菩提树上凝固的甘霖，闪耀于灯烛辉煌的殿堂里金色的经典。此后，我欠你几世温柔，转山转水转佛塔，不为了其余，只为了探求你更阑湿润的身影。
　　旧历年的年前，我的一个老师死了。一张A4的打印讣告，白刺刺地贴在墙上。清冷的夕阳下，冷风打着旋儿，撕扯着墙上残存的布告簌簌作响。远远近近地，响着新年后零星的爆竹...
	43、贫不足羞，可羞是贫而无志。
/ > there is a kind of happiness I don't know since when, to enjoy life has become my greatest pride.
Remember reading a book, there are many cliches are to encourage the bitter work of students.
Such as Edison's "failure is the mother of success" and the ancient words "short step, not that far away."
Carnegie's "who am I not line," "the most important thing in life 1/5 - every minute counts, advancing with The Times".
The teacher's interview, the impact of foreign success, let our life is full of a lot of must, must.
What I choose to stay away from these thoughts?
Is now in the self disappointed again and again.
There is no denying the fact that at first contact with these passionate words, my heart beat faster, always feel a distinctive already in blood flow, a kind of high aspirations have quietly flush the body.
But - when I closed the book, I don't have the feelings of blood, my life is still so ordinary, my life is still so - not so good.
And in the book, once saw hope, facing reality, is such a pale smile.
To self-help books until I could no longer familiar, I finally gave up the idea of absorbing power from among them.
Yes, I follow the voice of the heart, face the fact that they still can't change, negative heart to face every day, I can only follow the voice of the heart, let go of all these rules and give up all the necessary, to look for another kind of life - and now I know, this kind of life is called happiness.
I can only say, this kind of life, really very happy.
There is a saying very makes sense, "thinking changed, action will change.
Action has changed, the habit has changed.
Habits have changed, the personality is changed also.
Character has changed, destiny will change."
In the changes of heart, the heart, let me feel is alive is a how happy thing.
Now of I, still have do not over, still have done the dream, there are still unable to achieve.
Life, is so insipid.
Insipid to now I can't find the specific things to share with you.
The only want to talk, just a changed, full of joy and gratitude.
What makes me so happy?
Is to give up.
Yes, it is "cross the bridge when you come to it," give up, is long accumulation of dribs and drabs of life depends on the type of give up.
This kind of give up, happy.
I remembered once in a book idea: when a person find a job and want to adapt to the society, mentality and way of life, so, the person with their life, study, and the expectations of his is satisfactory, so, he felt that life is happy.
Now that I think about it, it does.
Only when I saw this passage of time, heart is anxious, is not sure for the future.
Today, happiness is so readily available.
How do you satisfied with yourself?
In this competitive society, how to be happy about your work and life?
After all, as long as we like, we can find out one thousand - ten thousand are not satisfied with their reasons, find out a lot of support in reason.
Quick update of knowledge, the health threat, the enterprise survival pressure directly affects the personal career planning at home and abroad as well as the political, economic, and the original living environment quality to drop, is eye-catching.
Relative, as long as we like, we can find the reason of "nothing", also can find one thousand ten thousand happy way and reason.
I believe that nothing can stop a person wants to happy determination.
First, the most important thing is the conscience.
Chat is boring.
Talent, according to the method, is also funny, but if the inside of the human life atrophy, is very bad.
